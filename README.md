# Flipping Card UI Design

This project showcases a flipping card UI design using HTML and CSS. The card flips to reveal additional information on its back face, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.

## Files

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the flipping card.
- **style.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the flipping card (not provided but assumed to be created).
- **chip.png**: Image of the chip used on the front face of the card.
- **Logo.png**: Image of the Master Card logo (should be included in the project directory).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure the `style.css` file and the images (`chip.png` and `Logo.png`) are in the correct paths as referenced in the HTML file.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the flipping card UI
